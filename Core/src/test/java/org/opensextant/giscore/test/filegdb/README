These tests require the presence of the FileGDB API library from ESRI and 
the appropriately compiled JNI library. Both should be compiled for a 
64 bit platform. 

For Windows you'll also need to install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 
Redistributable Package and the .Net 3.5 framework to satisfy the dll dependencies.
Install the .Net 3.5 SDK if you are running in debug mode. 

java.library.path only affects the loading of the dll from java, not the 
dependencies of the dll. For that you must set the PATH under Windows or the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH under Linux.
