## Geodesy API - org.opensextant.geodesy  ##

Geodesy is a geodetic library with basic representations for Latitude, Longitude, 
MGRS, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), 2-D and 3-D bounding boxes, etc.
It allows the construction of basic shapes on a specified ellipsoid world model.
You can then perform various operations on the shapes and points 
such as discovering distance, whether shapes intersect and such. The shapes can have altitude
but not an arbitrary 3D shape.
