         Use the following format to specify a custom IndexReaderFactory,

         Please note - Using a custom IndexReaderFactory may prevent

         IndexReaderFactory may change without warning or may even be

         ** Features that may not work with custom IndexReaderFactory **

         The ReplicationHandler assumes a disk-resident index. Using a

             A possible optimization that attempts to use a filter to

             score, then the filterCache will be checked for a filter
             matching the query. If found, the filter will be used as the
             source of document ids, and then the sort will be applied to
             that.

             For most situations, this will not be useful unless you
             frequently get the same search repeatedly with different sort
             options, and none of them ever use "score"

             requests matching documents 10 through 19, and queryWindowSize is 50,
             then documents 0 through 49 will be collected and cached.  Any further

    <!-- Request Dispatcher

         This section contains instructions for how the SolrDispatchFilter
         should behave when processing requests for this SolrCore.

         handleSelect is a legacy option that affects the behavior of requests
         such as /select?qt=XXX

         handleSelect="true" will cause the SolrDispatchFilter to process
         the request and dispatch the query to a handler specified by the
         "qt" param, assuming "/select" isn't already registered.

         handleSelect="false" will cause the SolrDispatchFilter to
         ignore "/select" requests, resulting in a 404 unless a handler
         is explicitly registered with the name "/select"

         handleSelect="true" is not recommended for new users, but is the default
         for backwards compatibility

             The following options can also be specified to affect the
             values of these headers...

             lastModFrom - the default value is "openTime" which means the

             requests) will all be relative to when the current Searcher
             was opened.  You can change it to lastModFrom="dirLastMod" if
             you want the value to exactly correspond to when the physical
             index was last modified.

             etagSeed="..." is an option you can change to force the ETag
             header (and validation against If-None-Match requests) to be
             different even if the index has not changed (ie: when making
             significant changes to your config file)

             (lastModifiedFrom and etagSeed are both ignored if you use
             the never304="true" option)

         http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrRequestHandler

         Incoming queries will be dispatched to a specific handler by name
         based on the path specified in the request.

         Legacy behavior: If the request path uses "/select" but no Request
         Handler has that name, and if handleSelect="true" has been specified in
         the requestDispatcher, then the Request Handler is dispatched based on
         the qt parameter.  Handlers without a leading '/' are accessed this way
         like so: http://host/app/[core/]select?qt=name  If no qt is
         given, then the requestHandler that declares default="true" will be
         used or the one named "standard".

         If a Request Handler is declared with startup="lazy", then it will
         not be initialized until the first request that uses it.
